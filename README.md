# dbusnotify

## Intro

*dbusnotify* sends a message to the `org.freedesktop.Notifications` DBUS
service, via the DBUS session bus, resulting in popup message on the current
UI graphical session window on a compliant BSD or Linux system.

In effect, *dbusnotify* is like *echo*(1), except that the output is emitted
through DBUS.

For installation instructions and additional documentation, see the
[*dbusnotify* web page][].
